# fbautorespond

A simple script to auto-respond to Facebook messages.

## Description

I don't use Facebook but many of my friends do.  I wanted a way to let
my friends know that I would not receive their messages unless they
sent them some other way.  This script allows you to set up a simple
auto-responder that will be sent when a new conversation is started
with you on Facebook messenger.
